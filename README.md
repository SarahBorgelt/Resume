## 💼 About Me

I am a passionate and motivated aspiring software engineer, transitioning from a professional background in supply chain to technology. My journey into coding began after a pivotal life moment in January 2025, when I lost my mother unexpectedly. This experience inspired me to pursue meaningful changes in my life, including exploring new career opportunities that aligned with my curiosity and problem-solving mindset.

Almost by chance, I enrolled in an introductory programming class through We Can Code IT, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I immediately discovered a love for creating functional and visually appealing web applications.

Building on that foundation, I completed the Responsive Web Design Certification through freeCodeCamp in June 2025, deepening my skills in modern web development and responsive design. Seeking a more comprehensive understanding of software engineering, I then enrolled in Tech Elevator, where I am currently mastering full-stack development with Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I am dedicated to building clean, user-friendly applications and continuously improving my skills through personal projects and hands-on practice. I am eager to contribute my technical abilities, creativity, and strong work ethic to a tech internship or entry-level role, where I can grow as a developer while making a meaningful impact.
